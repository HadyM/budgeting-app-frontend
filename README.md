# budgeting-app-frontend

A Front-end Budgeting App that utilizes a Back-end API that is deployed using Heroku. This app id designed using React, Axios, Bootstrap, React-Router-Dom, and CSS for animations. It utilizes the backend implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, & Delete) and MVC (Model-view controller). The app has an animated NavBar, Welcome Screen, and Background. When going to the indexes page the app shows a list of transactions with date, name, and amount as well as the total available balance. The total amount also changes color when under 100 to red and green when over 1000. This same color theme is also implemented when the amount is a negative amount or positive amount so the user can spot different transactions easily. When one of the indexes is click it will take the user to a more information page that provides more information about that transaction. The user can then edit, delete, or cancel that transaction. There is a New transaction page the allows the user to fill out a form that will then add to the index when completed. Deployed using Netlify connected with the Backend that is deployed using Heroku.
